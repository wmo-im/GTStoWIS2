==============
Message Format
==============

The payload of messages, regardless of the MQP chosen, should user readable
JSON. Server-side representation may vary, but the message should logically represent a product
that can be downloaded from a server.

a complete example being:: 

   {  "pubTime" : "20190120T045018.314854383Z", 
      "baseUrl" : "https://localhost/data/20190120", 
      "integrity": {"method": "sha512", "value": "A2KNxvks...S8qfSCw=="},
      "relPath" : "WIS/CA/CMC/UpperAir/04/UANT01_CWAO_200445___15103.txt", 
      "size": 457,
      "content" : { "encoding": "utf-8", "value": "encoded bytes from the file" },
      "retPath" : "4Pubsub/92c557ef-d28e-4713-91af-2e2e7be6f8ab" 
   }

Boiling it down to this relatively small example makes discussion easier.

*  The *pubTime* marks when the file was posted on the first broker in the network.
   This allows easy calculation of propagation delay across any number of nodes.
   The date format looks like a floating point number,  but is the conventional
   YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS (in UTC timezone) followed by a fraction of a second after the
   decimal place, and *Z* (timezone marker). all timestamps are always to be UTC.
   use of another timezone is considered an error.

   This is chosen rather than any sort of epochal second count for readability
   and to avoid worrying about leap seconds. This format is essentially ISO8601
   basic notation. The standard recommends a *T* be placed between date and time,
   and there is no convention to use a decimal marker for seconds. The use of a
   decimal marker allows for different users to give different levels of
   precision (milliseconds, microseconds, etc...) without ambiguity.

   The date-time stamp is critical for subscribers to prevent message loss by knowing
   their lag (how far behind the publisher they are.)

*  The *baseUrl* marks the static starting point to build the complete download URL.
   It represents the root of the download tree on the remote web server.

   Specifying the baseUrl in each message provides a number of benefits:
  
   - Use of schema gives mechanism for multiple protocols. Initially, subscribers
     shall support at least:

     * https
     * sftp
     * http/ftp (supported for legacy sources, though deprecated, only to be used for very public data.)

     This minimum list in will be reviewed in future from time to time.

   - enables third party transfer, where the broker announcing data doesn't necessarily
     have it locally, it might just know of a remote location, and not be interested in
     it for itself, but it could tell clients where to get it if they want it.

     Reduces load on broker, by having other nodes do the actual transfers.

   - allows many sources of data to be mixed in the same download stream.

   The baseUrl field can be replaced or turned into a list of alternatives 
   when re-publishing downloaded data.


*  the *relPath* is the rest of the download url.
   The public, portable name of the resources being published.
   Stays the same with republishing. Catenating the baseUrl and relPath normally
   results in a complete path to retrieve the upstream resource.
   The hierarchy in the relpath should match the topic hiearchy used to implement
   server-side filtering.

   The last element of the RelPath is the filename, and it should include an appropriate
   file type suffix. (examples: .txt, .bufr, .crex, .grib)


*  The *integrity* field specifies a checksum to be applied to the data to
   ensure that the download is accurate. A specific set of methods for calculating
   the checksum algorithms will be prescribed:

   - "sha512" -- the Secure Hash Algorithm 512 bits, value is base64 encoded.
   - "arbitrary" -- an arbitrary string is used to identify the value. 
   - "md5"   -- the Message Digest 5 hash (obsolete, perhaps will be rejected.)

*  The *Size* header contains an integer number of bytes contained in the file.
   together with the integrity, it provides additional assurance that file content
   was accurately received.


Optional Headers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By exchanging messages using only the above fields, enough metadata is provided
to permit downloads from peers with reasonable assurance.  Optional fields can 
additionally be included::

*  The *content* field can be used to embed small products within the message
   itself. Content will have an *encoding* field, of which two values are permitted:

   - *utf-8*
   - *base64*

   and the value will contain the body of the file in the appropriate encoding.

* The *retPath* header provides an alternate download URL, providing, for example,
  for direct retrieval from object stores.  This provides an optimization. 

* the *partitionStrategy* field can be included:: 

      { "method" : "partitioned",  -- either "partitioned" or "inplace"
        "blockNumber" : 0,         -- 1st partition/block sent. 
        "blockCount"  : 5,         -- how many blocks in total? 
        "blockSize"   : 52428800,  -- size of each block (except last one)
        "lastBlock"   : 125280     -- size of the last block.
      } 

  This field is used to transmit arbitrarily large files in pieces,
  to permit part of the file to be sent using multiple streams, and to
  reduce the amount of storage intervening systems need in order
  to transmit files. 
  
  When transmitting *inplace*, it means that the file is in one piece at source.
  for a *partitioned* file, only the referenced block is present at source.

  
Other Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is expected that, similarly to what is done in SMTP (Postel's law - "Be liberal 
in what you accept, and conservative in what you send." ), headers not defined in
the payload format, are passed through without modification. The Canadian stack, for example
other headers: *blocks*, *mtime*, *atime*, "mode", "rename", "link", are used for purposes not
standardized by the WMO. Also, in the Canadian context, it can be used to signify 
file removal, in which case an *integrity* checksum cannot be provided.

The actual checksum of the data downloaded must be compared with the
advertised one to identify issues. One should always publish with the checksum
that matches what was downloaded, rather than what was advertised, to avoid loops.



Sample Implementations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following implementations can be used to validate interoperability with
the standards:

- Canadian Sarracenia stack ( http://github.com/MetPX/sarracenia ) a complete reference implementation in Python >= 3.4. It runs on Linux, Mac, and Windows.

- proprietary interop? Jan?

- DWD?

- Japan? (how are DWD and Japan exchanging currently?)

- sarrac ( https://github.com/MetPX/sarrac ) is a partial C implementation. It is Linux only. There is also a libcshim to be able to tranparently implement data insertion with this tool, and libsarra allows C programs to post directly. There is consumer code as well (to read queues) but no downloading so far. This subset is meant to be used where python3 environments are impractical (some HPC environments).

Implementations by clients of the Canadian datamart service:

- node-sarra ( https://github.com/darkskyapp/node-sarra ) An embryonic implementation for node.js.

- ecpush ( https://github.com/TheTannerRyan/ecpush ) an simple client in Go ( http://golang.org )
